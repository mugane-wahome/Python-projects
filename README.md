## Description:

This project implements a linear regression model to predict temperature based on various environmental variables. It leverages the scikit-learn library in Python to train the model and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

###Key Functionalities:

###
Data Preparation:
Loads data from a CSV file (or adjust based on your data source).
Splits the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
Handles potential missing values ​​or data cleaning steps (if necessary).
Training Model:
Creates a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegressionclass.
Trains the model on the prepared training data (features and target variables).
Prediction:
Uses the trained model to predict temperature values ​​for new, unseen data points.
Evaluation:
Calculates metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy and generalizability.
Optionally prints the model coefficients to understand the influence of each feature on temperature prediction.
Potential Applications:

Weather forecasting (short-term or long-term)
Climate change analysis
Environmental monitoring
Smart agriculture (predicting optimal growing conditions)
(Add more relevant applications based on your project's focus)

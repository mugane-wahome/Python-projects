# Temperature predicion using multivariate regression

## Description
<p > 
 This project implements a multivariate regression model to predict temperature levels based on various environmental variables. It leverages the scikit-learn library in Python to train the model and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
</p>

## Key Functionalities:

### Data Preparation:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Feature selection
- Data splitting
### Training Model
- Creates a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegressionclass.
- Fit the model to the training data.

### Prediction 
- Uses the trained model to predict temperature values ​​for new, unseen data points.

### Evaluation
- Calculates metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy and generalizability.
- Optionally prints the model coefficients to understand the influence of each feature on temperature prediction.

## Potential Application: 
✔️ Weather forecasting (short-term or long-term)\
✔️ Climate change analysis\
✔️ Environmental monitoring\
✔️ Smart agriculture (predicting optimal growing conditions)\
